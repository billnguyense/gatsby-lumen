Hello! Welcome to my blog.

I am Bill, a software developer from Vietnam. I have been working in Singapore since 2012.

The idea of having a simple blog started in 2021, when I realized that I did not have a good place to consolidate the information, tips, and knowledge that I share with other people in various places: Live streams, talks, comments on Facebook groups or LinkedIn, messages in community Slack channels, or even private messages.

After much hesitation, here it is.

This blog is built using Gatsby on top of a MIT-licensed template from [alxshelepenok](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen)
